### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perfom a deep analysis on Kickstarter different campaigns outcomes (successful, Failed and canceled) based on their launch dates and funding goals and draw conclusion using dataset and visualizations. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter has multiple campaigns categories and subcategories. However, our analysis will focus more on parent category "Theater" and subcategory "plays" to provide a better insight into the campaigns' outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart below shows the number of successful, failed or canceled projects per month for Parent Category "Theater" based on their launch dates. The month of May showed the highest number of projects outcomes with a total of 166 while December had the lowest with 75 in total. From 166 projects launched in May, 111 were successful, while 52 failed and 3 were canceled. In December, 75 projects were launched, 37 of the projects were successful while 35 failed and 3 were canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To provide insight into campaigns outcomes based on funding goals, we used a dollar-amount ranges so projects can be grouped based on their goal amount. Then we calculated the percentage rate for the projects outcomes. From our analysis, 76% of the project with funding goal in range of less than 1000 were successful with 24% failed. 17% of the projects with funding goal of more than 50000 were successful with 83% failed.
The chart below shows the campaigns' outcomes based on funding goals for subcategory "plays".

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The mouths of May and June had the highest successful outcomes based on projects launch dates while december had the lowest successful outcome.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 
 
 From our analysis, 76% of the project with funding goal in range of less than 1000 were successful with 24% failed. 17% of the projects with funding goal of more than 50000 were successful with 83% failed.
 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
  
  Lack of statistical data to draw conclusion

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
